Database Querying:
* listFunctionsFinal.h

Unfortunately, our team did not read the homework prompt well and did a lot more work than was necessary. The following not fully commented files contain work that shows our attempts to actual find the path between two actors. It is not fully functional. 

* mdb.c is a file that we used to make a test database that we could test
* search.c is a file that has some of the starting logic to find a path between two actors
* test.c also has some of the searching logic that we've been testing.
